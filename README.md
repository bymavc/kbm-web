The concept of this application could be described like "A GitHub only for documents" and it works like this.

- The System has Users.
- Users have Knowledge Bases.
- Knowledge Bases can be Public or Private.
- Public Knowledge Bases can be seen by anyone, Private Knowledge Bases can only be seen by authorized Users.
- Knowledge Bases can have Folders and Documents inside.
- Folders can also have Folders and Documents inside.
- Documents are units of useful information.
- A Document can have from none to many Tags that describe its content.
- Knowledge Bases can have Members, Workers and an Owner.
- Members can see the Knowledge Base content even when it is a Private Knowledge Base.
- Workers can edit the Knowledge Base content.
- Owners can give memberships of the Knowledge Base to other Users, edit Knowledge Base Content, Change Knowledge Base privacy policies and give the Knowledge Base ownership to other User.
